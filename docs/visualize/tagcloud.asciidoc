== Tag Cloud

A tag cloud visualization is a representation of text data, typically used to visualize free form text. 
Tags are usually single words, and the importance of each tag is shown with font size or color.

The font size for each word is determined by the _metrics_ aggregation. The following aggregations are available for
this chart:
include::y-axis-aggs.asciidoc[]

The _buckets_ aggregations determine what information is being retrieved from your data set.

Select the *Tags* option to configure a _buckets_ aggregation.

You can specify the following bucket aggregations for tag cloud visualization:

*Terms*:: A {es-ref}search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html[_terms_] aggregation enables you to specify the top
or bottom _n_ elements of a  given field to display, ordered by count or a custom metric.

You can click the *Advanced* link to display more customization options for your metrics or bucket aggregation:

*JSON Input*:: A text field where you can add specific JSON-formatted properties to merge with the aggregation
definition, as in the following example:

[source,shell]
{ "script" : "doc['size'].value + 'px'" }

NOTE: In Elasticsearch releases 1.4.3 and later, this functionality requires you to enable
{es-ref}modules-scripting.html[dynamic Groovy scripting].

Select the *Options* tab to change the following aspects of the chart:

*Text Scale*:: You can select *linear*, *log*, or *square root* scales for the text scale. You can use a log
scale to display data that varies exponentially or a square root scale to
regularize the display of data sets with variabilities that are themselves highly variable. This kind of data, where
the variability is itself variable over the domain being examined, is known as _heteroscedastic_ data. For example, if
a data set of height versus weight has a relatively narrow range of variability at the short end of height, but a wider
range at the taller end, the data set is heteroscedastic.
*Orientation*::
- Single: all tags are orientation horizontally
- right angles: tags are oriented horionztally and vertically 
- multiple: tags are oriented with multiple orientations  
*Font Size*:: Set the minimum and maximum font size.
*Show Label*:: display or hide the default label.
