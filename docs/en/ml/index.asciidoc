As datasets increase in size and complexity, the human effort required to
inspect dashboards or maintain rules for spotting infrastructure problems,
cyber attacks, or business issues becomes impractical. The {xpack} {ml} features
automatically model the normal behavior of your time series data — learning
trends, periodicity, and more — in real time to identify anomalies, streamline
root cause analysis, and reduce false positives.

Installed with {xpack}, {ml} runs in and scales with {es}, and includes an
intuitive UI on the {kib} *Machine Learning* page for creating anomaly detection
jobs and understanding results.

You can use the *Job Management* pane to create and manage jobs and their
associated {dfeeds}.  For example:

image::ml/images/ml-job-management.jpg[Job Management]

The *Anomaly Explorer* and *Single Metric Viewer* display the results of your
{ml} jobs.  For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::ml/images/ml-single-metric-viewer.jpg[Single Metric Viewer]

NOTE: The {xpack} {ml} features in {kib} use pop-ups. You must configure your
web browser so that it does not block pop-up windows or create an exception for
your Kibana URL.

For more information about {ml}, see
{xpack-ref}/xpack-ml.html[Machine Learning in the Elastic Stack].
