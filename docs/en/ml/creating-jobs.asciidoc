== Creating Machine Learning Jobs

Machine learning jobs contain the configuration information and metadata
necessary to perform an analytics task.

{kib} provides the following wizards to make it easier to create jobs:

A single metric job is a simple job that contains a single _detector_. A
detector defines the type of analysis that will occur and which fields to
analyze. In addition to limiting the number of detectors, the single metric job
creation wizard omits many of the more advanced configuration options.

A multi-metric job can contain more than one detector, which is more efficient
than running multiple jobs against the same data.

An advanced job can contain multiple detectors and enables you to configure all
job settings.

NOTE: If your data is located outside of {es}, you cannot use {kib} to create
your jobs and you cannot use {dfeeds} to retrieve your data in real time.
Machine learning analysis is still possible, however, by using APIs to
create and manage jobs and post data to them. For more information, see
{ref}/ml-apis.html[Machine Learning APIs].
