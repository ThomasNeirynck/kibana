= Kibana View Modes

{xpack} supports two view modes that you can assign to roles: *All apps* or *View dashboards only*.
The *All apps* view mode is enabled for new roles by default, which enables users assigned the role
to see all Kibana apps.

When you enable the *View dashboards only* mode for a role, users assigned the role can only see and use
the Dashboard app and all edit controls are hidden.

IMPORTANT: If a user has multiple roles and any role has the *All apps* view mode enabled, the user can
see all Kibana apps.

In *View dashboards only* mode, Dashboard is the only app visible and the Dashboard page shows all
available dashboards.

When you view a dashboard in *View dashboards only mode*, no editing tools are available.

This setting is available when editing or creating a role under *Management > Roles*.

IMPORTANT: We recommend that you give roles that enable *View dashboards only* mode
