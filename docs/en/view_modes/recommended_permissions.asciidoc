=== Recommended permissions for view dashboard only roles

When you enable *View dashboard only* mode for a role, you should also restrict the role to read-only access
to the Kibana index. For Kibana to work properly in read-only mode, the role must have the `read` and
`view_index_metadata` privileges for the Kibana index.

Users must also have read access to the indices that contain the data for your dashboards.
The `view_index_metadata` permission is not required for data indices.

IMPORTANT: All roles you assign to dashboard-only users must have *View dashboards only* enabled.
If any role has *All apps* view mode enabled, the users will be able to see all Kibana apps

When you create or update dashboard-only users from *Management > Users*, assign both the read-only
data and read-only Kibana index roles.
