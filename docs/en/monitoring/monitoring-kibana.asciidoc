== Monitoring Kibana

To monitor {kib}:

. Install {xpack}. See {kibana-ref}/installing-xpack-kb.html[Installing {xpack}].

. {kib} automatically sends metrics to the {es} cluster specified in the
`elasticsearch.url` property in `kibana.yml`, which defaults to
`http://localhost:9200`.
+
NOTE: You can set the `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.url` in `kibana.yml`
to specify the {es} cluster that {kib} should _retrieve_ monitoring
data from. This enables you to use a single {kib} instance to search and
visualize data in your production cluster as well as monitor data sent
to a dedicated monitoring cluster.

. Restart {kib}.

. To verify your {monitoring} configuration, point your web browser at your {kib}
host, and select **Monitoring** from the side navigation. Metrics reported from
{kib} should be visible in the {kib} section. When security is
enabled, to view the monitoring dashboards you must log in to {kib} as a user
who has both the `kibana_user` and `monitoring_user` roles. For example:
