== Viewing Monitoring Metrics

The Clusters page summarizes the status of your Elastic stack. You can drill
down into the metrics to view more information about your cluster and
specific nodes, instances, and indices.

[[cluster-alerts]]
=== Cluster Alerts

The Top Cluster Alerts shown on the Clusters page notify you of
conditions that require your attention:

* Elasticsearch Cluster Health Status is Yellow (missing at least one replica)
or Red (missing at least one primary).
* Elasticsearch Version Mismatch. You have Elasticsearch nodes with
different versions in the same cluster.
* Kibana Version Mismatch. You have Kibana instances with different
versions running against the same Elasticsearch cluster.
+
If you do not preserve the data directory when upgrading a Kibana or
Logstash node, the instance is assigned a new persistent UUID and shows up
as a new instance
* Logstash Version Mismatch. You have Logstash nodes with different versions
running against the same Elasticsearch cluster.

Monitoring checks the cluster alert conditions every minute. Cluster
alerts are automatically dismissed when the condition is resolved.

[[elasticsearch-metrics]]
=== Elasticsearch Metrics

You can drill down into the status of your Elasticsearch cluster by clicking
the <<cluster-overview-page, Overview>>, <<nodes-page, Nodes>>, and
<<indices-overview-page, Indices>> links.

[float]
[[cluster-overview-page]]
==== Cluster Overview

To view the key metrics that indicate the overall health of an Elasticsearch
cluster, click **Overview** in the Elasticsearch section. Anything that
needs your attention is highlighted in yellow or red.

TIP: Conditions that require your attention are listed at the top of the
Clusters page. You can also set up watches to alert you when the status
of your cluster changes. To learn how, see <<watch-cluster-status, Watch
Your Cluster Health>>.

The panel at the top shows the current cluster statistics, the charts show the
search and indexing performance over time, and the table at the bottom shows
information about any shards that are being recovered.

TIP: Not sure what a chart is showing? Click the info button for a description
of the metrics.

From there, you can dive into detailed metrics for particular nodes and indices.

[[nodes-page]]
==== Nodes

To view node metrics, click **Nodes**. The Nodes section shows the status
of each node in your cluster.

[float]
[[nodes-page-overview]]
===== Node Overview

Click the name of a node to view its node statistics over time. These represent high-level
statistics collected from Elasticsearch that provide a good overview of health.

[float]
[[nodes-page-advanced]]
===== Node Advanced

To view advanced node metrics, click the **Advanced** tab for a node. The Advanced tab
shows additional metrics, such as memory and garbage collection statistics
reported by the selected Elasticsearch node.

image::images/monitoring-node-advanced.png["Elasticsearch Node Advanced",link="images/monitoring-node-advanced.png"]

The Advanced node view can be used to diagnose issues that generally involve
more advanced knowledge of Elasticsearch, such as poor garbage collection performance.


[float]
[[indices-overview-page]]
==== Indices

To view index metrics, click **Indices**. The Indices section shows the same
overall index and search metrics as the Overview and a table of your indices.

image::images/monitoring-indices.jpg["Elasticsearch Indices",link="images/monitoring-indices.jpg"]

[float]
[[indices-page-overview]]
===== Index Overview

From the Indices listing, you can view data for a particular index. To drill down into the data
for a particular index, click its name in the Indices table.

image::images/monitoring-index.jpg["Elasticsearch Index Overview",link="images/monitoring-index.jpg"]

[float]
[[indices-page-advanced]]
===== Index Advanced

To view advanced index metrics, click the **Advanced** tab for an index. The Advanced tab
shows additional metrics, such as memory statistics reported about the Elasticsearch
index. If the index has more than one shard, then its shards may live on more than one
node.

image::images/monitoring-index-advanced.png["Elasticsearch Index Advanced",link="images/monitoring-index-advanced.png"]

The Advanced index view can be used to diagnose issues that generally involve
more advanced knowledge of Elasticsearch, such as wasteful index memory usage.


[float]
[[kibana-page]]
=== Kibana

To view the key metrics that indicate the overall health of Kibana itself,
click **Overview** in the Kibana section.

image::images/monitoring-kibana-overview.jpg["Kibana Overview",link="images/monitoring-kibana-overview.jpg"]

To view Kibana instance metrics, click **Instances**. The Instances section
shows the status of each Kibana instance.

image::images/monitoring-kibana-instances.jpg["Kibana Instances",link="images/monitoring-kibana-instances.jpg"]

Click the name of an instance to view its instance statistics over time.

image::images/monitoring-kibana-instance.jpg["Kibana Instance View",link="images/monitoring-kibana-instance.jpg"]

[float]
[[logstash-page]]
=== Logstash

If you are <<monitoring-logstash, Monitoring Logstash nodes>>, click **Overview** in the Logstash section to view the overall health of those nodes.

image::images/monitoring-logstash-overview.jpg["Logstash Overview",link="images/monitoring-logstash-overview.jpg"]

To view Logstash node metrics, click **Nodes**. The Nodes section
shows the status of each Logstash node.

image::images/monitoring-logstash-nodes.jpg["Logstash Nodes",link="images/monitoring-logstash-nodes.jpg"]

Click the name of a node to view its statistics over time.
