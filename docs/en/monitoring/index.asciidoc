The {xpack} monitoring components enable you to easily monitor the Elastic Stack
from {kib}. You can view health and performance data for {es}, Logstash, and
{kib} in real time, as well as analyze past performance.

When you install {xpack}, a monitoring agent runs on each {es}, {kib}, and
Logstash instance to collect and index metrics.

For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring the Elastic Stack].
