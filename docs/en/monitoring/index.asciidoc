The {xpack} monitoring components enable you to easily monitor the Elastic Stack
from {kib}. You can view health and performance data for {es}, Logstash, and
{kib} in real time, as well as analyze past performance. For more information,
see {xpack-ref}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring the Elastic Stack].

When you install {xpack}, a monitoring agent runs on each {es} node, Logstash
node, and {kib} instance to collect and index metrics. Each node and instance is
considered unique based on its persistent UUID, which is written to the
<<settings,`path.data`>> directory when the node or instance starts.
