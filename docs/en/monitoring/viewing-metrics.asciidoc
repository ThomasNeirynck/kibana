<titleabbrev>Viewing Monitoring Data</titleabbrev>
++++

Monitoring is automatically enabled when you
{xpack-ref}/installing-xpack.html[install {xpack}] into {es}, Logstash, and
{kib}. By default, the monitoring agents on {es} index data within the same
cluster.

TIP: If you have a
{xpack-ref}/monitoring-cluster.html[dedicated monitoring cluster],
the information is accessible even if the {es} cluster you're monitoring
is not. You can send data from multiple clusters to the same monitoring cluster
and view them all through the same instance of {kib}.

To view and analyze the health and performance of {es}, Logstash, and {kib}:

. Open {kib} in your web browser and log in. If you are running {kib}
locally, go to `http://localhost:5601/`. To access {kib} and view the
monitoring dashboards, you must log in as a user who has the `kibana_user`
and `monitoring_user` roles.

. Click **Monitoring** in the side navigation. This displays any
{xpack-ref}/monitoring-details.html#cluster-alerts[cluster alerts] that require
your attention and a summary of the available monitoring metrics for {es},
Logstash, and {kib}. To view additional information, click the Overview, Nodes,
Indices, or Instances links.
