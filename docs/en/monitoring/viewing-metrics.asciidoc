Monitoring is automatically enabled when you install {xpack} into {es}, Logstash,
and {kib}. You can also enable monitoring in Beats. By default, the monitoring
agents on {es} index data within the same cluster.

TIP: If you have a dedicated monitoring cluster, the information is accessible
even if the {es} cluster you're monitoring is not. You can send data from
multiple clusters to the same monitoring cluster and view them all through the
same instance of {kib}. For  more information, see

To view and analyze the health and performance of {es}, Logstash, {kib}, and
Beats:

. {ref}/installing-xpack-es.html[Install {xpack} in {es}]. If you want to use a
separate monitoring cluster, see
{xpack-ref}/monitoring-production.html[Monitoring in a Production Environment].

. <<installing-xpack-kb,Install {xpack} in {kib}>> and
<<monitoring-xpack-kibana,configure monitoring>>.

. {logstash-ref}/installing-xpack-log.html[Install {xpack} in Logstash] and
{logstash-ref}/configuring-logstash.html[configure monitoring].

. Configure monitoring in Auditbeat, Filebeat, Heartbeat, Metricbeat, Packetbeat,
and Winlogbeat.

. Open {kib} in your web browser and log in. If you are running {kib}
locally, go to `http://localhost:5601/`. To access {kib} and view the
monitoring dashboards, you must log in as a user who has the `kibana_user`
and `monitoring_user` roles.

. Click **Monitoring** in the side navigation. This displays any cluster alerts
that require your attention and a summary of the available monitoring metrics
for {es}, Logstash, {kib}, and Beats. To view additional information, click the
Overview, Nodes, Indices, or Instances links.
