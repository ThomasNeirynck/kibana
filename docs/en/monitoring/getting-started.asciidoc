[[monitoring-getting-started]]
== Getting Started

Monitoring is automatically enabled when you <<installing-xpack, install
{xpack}>> into Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. By default, the monitoring
agents on Elasticsearch index data within the same cluster.

TIP: If you <<monitoring-cluster, send data to a separate monitoring cluster>>,
the information is accessible even if the Elasticsearch cluster you're monitoring
is not. You can send data from multiple clusters to the same monitoring cluster
and view them all through the same instance of Kibana.

To view and analyze the health and performance of Elasticsearch, Logstash,
and Kibana:

. Open Kibana in your web browser and log in. If you are running Kibana
locally, go to `http://localhost:5601/`. To access Kibana and view the
monitoring dashboards, you must log in as a user who has the `kibana_user`
and `monitoring_user` roles.

. Click **Monitoring** in the side navigation:

[[cluster-overview-page]]
=== Cluster Overview

To view the key metrics that indicate the overall health of an Elasticsearch 
cluster, click **Overview** in the Elasticsearch section. Anything that
needs your attention is highlighted in yellow or red. 

TIP: Did you know that you can also set up watches to alert you when the status
of your cluster changes? To learn how, see <<watch-cluster-status, Watch 
Your Cluster Health>>.

The panel at the top shows the current cluster statistics, the charts show the
search and indexing performance over time, and the table at the bottom shows
information about any shards that are being recovered.

TIP: Not sure what a chart is showing? Click the info button for a description
of the metrics.

From there, you can dive into detailed metrics for particular nodes and indices.

[[indices-overview-page]]
=== Indices

To view index metrics, click **Indices**. The Indices section shows the same
overall index and search metrics as the Overview and a table of your indices.

[[indices-page-overview]]
==== Index Overview

From the Indices listing, you can view data for a particular index. To drill down into the data
for a particular index, click its name in the Indices table.

[[indices-page-advanced]]
==== Index Advanced

To view advanced index metrics, click the **Advanced** tab for an index. The Advanced tab
shows additional metrics, such as memory statistics reported about the Elasticsearch
index. If the index has more than one shard, then its shards may live on more than one
node.

The Advanced index view can be used to diagnose issues that generally involve
more advanced knowledge of Elasticsearch, such as wasteful index memory usage.

[[nodes-page]]
=== Nodes

To view node metrics, click **Nodes**. The Nodes section shows the status
of each node in your cluster.

[[nodes-page-overview]]
==== Node Overview

Click the name of a node to view its node statistics over time. These represent high-level
statistics collected from Elasticsearch that provide a good overview of health.

[float]
[[nodes-page-advanced]]
==== Node Advanced

To view advanced node metrics, click the **Advanced** tab for a node. The Advanced tab
shows additional metrics, such as memory and garbage collection statistics
reported by the selected Elasticsearch node.

The Advanced node view can be used to diagnose issues that generally involve
more advanced knowledge of Elasticsearch, such as poor garbage collection performance.

[[kibana-page]]
=== Kibana

To view the key metrics that indicate the overall health of Kibana itself,
click **Overview** in the Kibana section.

image::images/monitoring-kibana-overview.jpg["Kibana Overview",link="images/monitoring-kibana-overview.jpg"]

To view Kibana instance metrics, click **Instances**. The Instances section
shows the status of each Kibana instance.

image::images/monitoring-kibana-instances.jpg["Kibana Instances",link="images/monitoring-kibana-instances.jpg"]

Click the name of an instance to view its instance statistics over time.

[[logstash-page]]
=== Logstash

If you are <<monitoring-logstash, Monitoring Logstash nodes>>, click **Overview** in the Logstash section to view the overall health of those nodes.

image::images/monitoring-logstash-overview.jpg["Logstash Overview",link="images/monitoring-logstash-overview.jpg"]

To view Logstash node metrics, click **Nodes**. The Nodes section
shows the status of each Logstash node.

Click the name of a node to view its statistics over time.
