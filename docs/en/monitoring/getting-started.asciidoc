== Getting Started

Monitoring is automatically enabled when you <<installing-xpack, install
{xpack}>> into Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. By default, the monitoring
agents on Elasticsearch index data within the same cluster.

TIP: If you {xpack-ref}/monitoring-cluster.html[dedicated monitoring cluster],
the information is accessible even if the Elasticsearch cluster you're monitoring
is not. You can send data from multiple clusters to the same monitoring cluster
and view them all through the same instance of Kibana.

To view and analyze the health and performance of Elasticsearch, Logstash,
and Kibana:

. Open Kibana in your web browser and log in. If you are running Kibana
locally, go to `http://localhost:5601/`. To access Kibana and view the
monitoring dashboards, you must log in as a user who has the `kibana_user`
and `monitoring_user` roles.

. Click **Monitoring** in the side navigation. This displays any
{xpack-ref}/monitoring-details.html#cluster-alerts[cluster alerts] that require your attention and a
summary of the available monitoring metrics for Elasticsearch, Logstash,
and Kibana. To view additional information, click the Overview, Nodes, Indices,
or Instances links.
