== Monitoring Logstash

To monitor Logstash nodes:

. Install {xpack} by running `bin/logstash-plugin install` in the Logstash
installation directory on each node you want to monitor:
+
[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------
bin/logstash-plugin install x-pack
----------------------------------------------------------
+
NOTE: The plugin install script requires direct Internet access
to download and install {xpack}. If your Logstash node doesnâ€™t have
Internet access, manually download and install {xpack}.
See {xpack-ref}/installing-xpack.html[Installing {xpack}].

. Configure your Logstash nodes to send metrics to your
Elasticsearch cluster by setting the `xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.url`
in `logstash.yml`. If security is enabled, you also need to specify
the credentials for the built-in `logstash_system` user.
+
IMPORTANT: To visualize Logstash as part of the Stack (shown below in Step 5), 
send metrics to your _production_ cluster. 
Sending metrics to a dedicated monitoring cluster 
will show the Logstash metrics under the _monitoring_ cluster.
+
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.url: ["http://es-prod-node-1:9200", "http://es-prod-node-2:9200"] <1>
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.username: "logstash_system" <2>
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password: "changeme"
--------------------------------------------------
<1> If SSL/TLS is enabled on the production cluster, you must
connect through HTTPS. As of v5.2.1, you can specify multiple
Elasticsearch hosts as an array as well as specifying a single
host as a string. If multiple URLs are specified, Logstash
can round-robin requests to these production nodes.
<2> The `logstash_system` user is automatically added when you
install {xpack}. Don't forget to change the default passwords for all of the
<<built-in-users, built in users>>. If {security} is disabled on the production
cluster, you can omit the `username` and `password` for the agent.

. If SSL/TLS is enabled on the production Elasticsearch cluster, specify the trusted
CA certificate(s) that will be used to verify the identity of the nodes
in the cluster.
+
--
To add a CA certificate to a Logstash node's trusted certificates, you
can specify the location of the PEM encoded certificate with the
`ca` setting:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.ca: [ "/path/to/ca.crt" ]
--------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, you can configure trusted certificates using a truststore
(a Java Keystore file that contains the certificates):

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.path: /path/to/file
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.truststore.password: password
--------------------------------------------------

Also, optionally, you can set up client certificate using a keystore
(a Java Keystore file that contains the certificate):

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.path: /path/to/file
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.ssl.keystore.password: password
--------------------------------------------------

Set sniffing to `true` to enable discovery of other nodes of the
elasticsearch cluster. Defaults to `false`.

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.sniffing: false
--------------------------------------------------

--

. Restart your Logstash nodes.

. To verify your {monitoring} configuration, point your web browser at your Kibana
host, and select **Monitoring** from the side navigation. Metrics reported from
your Logstash nodes should be visible in the Logstash section. When security is
enabled, to view the monitoring dashboards you must log in to Kibana as a user
who has the `kibana_user` and `monitoring_user` roles.

=== Re-enabling Logstash Monitoring After Upgrading

When upgrading from older versions of {xpack}, the built-in `logstash_system`
user is disabled for security reasons. To resume monitoring, <<monitoring-troubleshooting, change the password and re-enable the logstash_system user>>.
