=== Getting Started
:ref: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current

Watcher is automatically enabled when you {ref}/installing-xpack.html[install X-Pack] into Elasticsearch and Kibana.

To use the Watcher UI, you need to create users with Watcher specific roles as <<watcher-security,described here>>.

To access Watcher UI within Kibana:

. Open Kibana in your web browser and log in. If you are running Kibana
locally, go to `http://localhost:5601/`.

. Click **Management** in the side navigation, then select **Watcher** under `Elasticsearch`.

The watch list page within Watcher UI enables you to view all existing watches including stateful information about each watch. This includes `State`, `Last Fired` and `Last Triggered`.

The possible states for watches are:

* `Firing` - The watch is currently triggered and is actively performing the associated actions.
* `Error` - The watch is an error state and not properly working.
* `Ok` - The watch is not actively firing but working properly.
* `Disabled` - The watch will not fire under any circumstance.

To delete or edit a watch, click on its checkbox in the list and then click the Delete or Edit button. Watches that do not have a checkbox are https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/monitoring-details.html#cluster-alerts[cluster alerts] created by X-Pack monitoring and are immutable.

This page also allows you to create a <<watcher-create-threshold-alert, threshold alert>> or <<watcher-create-advanced-watch, an advanced watch>>. Let's first look at creating a threshold alert.
