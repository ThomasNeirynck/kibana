=== Reporting Settings in Kibana
++++
<titleabbrev>Reporting Settings</titleabbrev>
++++

You configure `xpack.reporting` settings in `kibana.yml` to
control how {reporting} <<reporting-kibana-server-settings, communicates
with the Kibana server>>, <<reporting-job-queue-settings, manages background
jobs>>, and <<reporting-capture-settings, captures screenshots>>.

[float]
[[general-reporting-settings]]
==== General Reporting Settings
`xpack.reporting.enabled`::
Set to `false` to disable {reporting}.

`xpack.reporting.encryptionKey`::
Set to any text string. By default, Kibana generates a random key when it starts,
which causes any pending reports to fail on restart. Configure this setting to use
the same key across restarts.

[float]
[[reporting-kibana-server-settings]]
==== Kibana Server Settings

Reporting uses the Kibana interface to generate reports. In most cases, you don't need
to configure Reporting to communicate with Kibana, it just works out of the box.
However, if you use a proxy in your stack or otherwise change how you access Kibana, you
might need to configure the following settings.

`xpack.reporting.kibanaServer.port`::
The port used to access Kibana, if different than the `server.port` value.

`xpack.reporting.kibanaServer.protocol`::
The protocol used to access Kibana, typically `http` or `https`.

`xpack.reporting.kibanaServer.hostname`::
The hostname used to access Kibana, if different than the `server.name` value.

[float]
[[reporting-job-queue-settings]]
==== Background Job Settings

Reporting generates reports in the background and jobs are coordinated using documents
in Elasticsearch. Depending on how often you generate reports and the overall number of
reports, you may need to change some of the following settings.

`xpack.reporting.queue.indexInterval`::
How often the index that stores reporting jobs rolls over to a new index.
Valid values are `year`, `month`, `week`, `day`, and `hour`. Defaults to `week`.

`xpack.reporting.queue.pollInterval`::
How often idle workers poll the index for pending jobs. Defaults to `3000` (3 seconds).

`xpack.reporting.queue.timeout`::
How long each worker has to produce a report. If your machine is slow or under constant
heavy load, you might need to increase this timeout. Specified in milliseconds.
Defaults to `30000` (30 seconds).

[float]
[[reporting-capture-settings]]
==== Capture Settings

Reporting works by capturing screenshots from Kibana. These settings are used to
control various aspects of the capturing process.

`xpack.reporting.capture.concurrency`::
The number of concurrent capture processes to run. Note that jobs are CPU bound,
and exceeding the number of cores available on the machine will likely be very
slow and might cause issues. Defaults to the number of cores on
the machine.

`xpack.reporting.capture.loadDelay`::
When visualizations are not evented, this is the amount of time to before
taking a screenshot. All visualizations that ship with Kibana are evented, so this
setting shouldn't have much effect. If you are seeing empty images instead of
visualizations in your reports, try increasing this value.
Defaults to `3000` (3 seconds).

`xpack.reporting.capture.browser.type`::
Specifies the browser that should be used for capturing the screenshots. Valid options are `phantom`
and `chromium`. When `chromium` is selected, the settings specified in the <<reporting-chromium-settings>> section
below are respected.
Defaults to `phantom`.

[float]
[[reporting-chromium-settings]]
==== Chromium Settings

When `xpack.reporting.capture.browser.type` is set to `chromium` the following settings can also be specified

`xpack.reporting.capture.browser.chromium.disableSandbox`::
Chromium implements it's own Sandbox that utilizes the OS-provided security mechanisms, and in certain
scenarios it may need to be disabled. This is primarily an issue when running Kibana/Chromium in a
docker container as the seccomp-bpf filters and AppArmor profiles that the Docker host enforce can
prevent the Sandboxing techniques and cause Chromium to crash on startup.
Default to `false`

`xpack.reporting.capture.browser.chromium.proxy.enabled`::
Enable the proxy for Chromium to use. When this is set to `true`, the
`xpack.reporting.capture.browser.chromium.proxy.server` setting must be specified.
Defaults to `false`

`xpack.reporting.capture.browser.chromium.proxy.server`::
The uri for the proxy server. Providing the username/password for the proxy server via the uri is not supported.


`xpack.reporting.capture.browser.chromium.proxy.bypass`::
An array of hosts that shouldn't go through the proxy server and instead use a direct connection.
Examples of valid entries: "elastic.co", "*.elastic.co", ".elastic.co", ".elastic.co:5601"


[float]
[[reporting-csv-settings]]
==== CSV Settings
`xpack.reporting.csv.maxSizeBytes`::
The maximum size that a CSV may reach before being truncated. This exists to prevent
unintentionally large exports from causing performance and storage issues.
Defaults to `10485760` (10mB)

[float]
[[reporting-advanced-settings]]
==== Advanced Settings

`xpack.reporting.index`::
Reporting uses a weekly index in Elasticsearch to store the reporting job and the report
content. The index will be created automatically if it does not already exist.
Defaults to `.reporting`

`xpack.reporting.roles.allow`::
Specifies the roles in addition to superusers that are allowed to access reporting.
Defaults to `[ "reporting_user" ]`
