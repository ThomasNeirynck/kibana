You do not need to configure any additional settings to use {security} in {kib}.
It is enabled by default.

`xpack.security.enabled`::
Set to `true` (default) to enable {security}. +
+
If set to `false` in `kibana.yml`, the user and role management options are
hidden in this {kib} instance. If `xpack.security.enabled` is set to `true` in
`elasticsearch.yml`, however, you can still use the {security} APIs. To disable
{security} entirely, see the
{ref}/security-settings.html[{es} Security Settings].
