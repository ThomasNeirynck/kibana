== Installing X-Pack

After you install {kib}, you can optionally obtain and install {xpack}.
For more information about how to obtain {xpack},
see https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack.


NOTE: You must run the version of {xpack} that matches the version of {kib}
you are running.

//TBD: Is it a requirement that you install X-Pack on ES before you install it
//on Kibana? i.e. is the order important?

To install {xpack} in {kib}:

. Optional: If you want to install {kib} on a machine that doesn't have internet
access:

.. Manually download the {xpack} zip file:
https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/packs/x-pack/x-pack-{version}.zip[
+https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/packs/x-pack/x-pack-{version}.zip+]
(https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/packs/x-pack/x-pack-{version}.zip.sha1[sha1])

.. Transfer the zip file to a temporary directory on the offline machine. (Do NOT
put the file in the {es} plugins directory.)

. Run `bin/kibana-plugin` in your {kib} installation directory.

--
[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------
bin/kibana-plugin install x-pack
----------------------------------------------------------

The plugin install scripts require direct internet access to download and
install {xpack}. If your server doesnâ€™t have internet access, specify the
location of the {xpack} zip file that you downloaded to a temporary directory.

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----------------------------------------------------------
bin/kibana-plugin install file:///path/to/file/x-pack-{version}.zip
----------------------------------------------------------

--

. Start {kib}.
+
[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------
bin/kibana
----------------------------------------------------------


To verify {xpack} installation, point your web browser at `http://localhost:5601/`
to open {kib}. You should be prompted to log in to {kib}. To log in, you can
use the built-in `elastic` user and the password `changeme`.

[IMPORTANT]
=============================================================================
SSL/TLS encryption is disabled by default, which means user credentials are
passed in the clear. **Do not deploy to production without enabling encryption!**
For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/encrypting-communications.html[Encrypting Communications].

You must also change the passwords for the built-in `elastic` user and the
`kibana` user that enables Kibana to communicate with elasticsearch before
deploying to production. For  more information, see
{xpack-ref}/setting-up-authentication.html#built-in-users[Setting Up User Authentication].
