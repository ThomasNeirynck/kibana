= Reporting from Kibana

[partintro]
--
{xpack} enables you to generate reports that contain Kibana dashboards,
visualizations, and saved searches. The reports are exported as
print-optimized PDF documents.

NOTE: On Linux, the `libfontconfig` and `libfreetype6` packages and system
fonts are required to generate reports. If no system fonts are available,
labels are not rendered correctly in the reports.

When you install {xpack} into Kibana, a Reporting button is added to the
toolbar:

You can also <<automating-report-generation, generate reports automatically>>.

IMPORTANT: Reports are stored in the `.reporting-*` indices. Any user with
access to these indices has access to every report generated by all users.

To use {reporting} in a production environment, <<securing-reporting, secure
the Reporting endpoints>>.
