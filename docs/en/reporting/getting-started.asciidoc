== Getting Started

{reporting} is automatically enabled when you install {xpack} into {kib}. For
more information, see {kibana-ref}/installing-xpack-kb.html[Installing {xpack}].

To manually generate a report:

. Open Kibana in your web browser and log in. If you are running Kibana
locally, go to `http://localhost:5601`. To access Kibana and generate
reports, you need the `kibana_user` and `reporting_user` roles. For more
information, see <<secure-reporting>>.

. Open the dashboard, visualization, or saved search you want to include
in the report.

. Click *Reporting* in the Kibana toolbar:
