locally, go to `http://localhost:5601`. To access Kibana and generate
reports, you need the `kibana_user` and <<secure-reporting, `reporting_user`>>
roles.

. Open the dashboard, visualization, or saved search you want to include
in the report.

. Click *Reporting* in the Kibana toolbar:

If you want to automatically generate reports from a script or with
